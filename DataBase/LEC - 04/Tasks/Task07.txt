4. Oracle Conditional Expressions – CASE Expressions
Create a students table with name and score columns. Insert at least 5 records.

Write a query using CASE to assign grades based on the score:

90 and above: A

80–89: B

70–79: C

Below 70: F

Modify the query to display “Pass” if score is 60 or more, otherwise “Fail”.

Use CASE to display a message for each student:

"Excellent" for A, "Good" for B, "Average" for C, and "Needs Improvement" for F.

Write a CASE expression using system date to return the name of the day (e.g., “Today is Monday”).

5. Oracle Conditional Expressions – DECODE Function
Use DECODE to return grade letters ('A', 'B', 'C', 'F') based on specific score values (e.g., 100 = A, 90 = B, etc.).

Create a status_log table with a status_code column containing values like ‘N’, ‘I’, ‘C’.

Use DECODE to convert:

‘N’ → ‘New’

‘I’ → ‘In Progress’

‘C’ → ‘Completed’

Use DECODE to check if a product’s quantity is 0, and display “Out of Stock”, otherwise “Available”.

Write a query using DECODE to display a bonus:

If department is ‘HR’ → 500

If department is ‘IT’ → 1000

If department is ‘Sales’ → 1500
